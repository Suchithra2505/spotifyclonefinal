# spotifyclonefinal
This project involves the creation of a Spotify clone using HTML and CSS. The objective is to imitate the primary interfaces and functionality of the Spotify web app leveraging these web technologies. 
The final product will include essential components such as the header, featured section, music player, playlist grid, playlist detail page, and browse section.

The UI design takes inspiration from Spotify's web application. Please refer to the Figma link for the detailed UI specifications:
